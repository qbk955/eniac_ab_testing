## Summary of Eniac A/B testing
The project involved evaluating the effectiveness of different button designs on a website to improve user engagement. Specifically, we tested four variants of a button (Version A, B, C, and D) to determine which design resulted in the highest click-through rate (CTR).

### Main Skills Practiced

1. **Statistical Analysis**: I utilized statistical methods such as the chi-square test, to analyze click-through rates across different button variations. This involved hypothesis testing to determine whether observed differences in performance were statistically significant.

2. **Experimental Design**: I designed and implemented an experiment to test multiple variants of a website feature. This included defining null and alternative hypotheses, selecting metrics, and determining statistical significance thresholds.

3. **Post-Hoc Analysis**: I performed post-hoc tests to refine the results of the chi-square test, adjusting for multiple comparisons using the Bonferroni Adjustment. This helps in mitigating Type I errors and improving the reliability of the findings.

4. **Critical Thinking**: Analyzed potential issues with the data, such as missing information and variations in performance. This skill is essential for adapting analysis strategies and ensuring robust conclusions.

### Insights Gained

1. **Understanding of Experimental Metrics**: I learned to choose appropriate metrics for evaluating the success of an experiment. Metrics such as click-through rate, drop-off rate, and homepage-return rate provide different perspectives on user behavior and performance.

2. **Importance of Statistical Significance**: Gained a deeper understanding of statistical significance and its role in making data-driven decisions. Recognizing the importance of setting appropriate thresholds and adjusting for multiple comparisons is crucial for accurate analysis.

3. **Handling Data Imperfections**: Encountered challenges related to missing data and variations in metrics. This highlighted the importance of robust data collection and handling methods to ensure accurate and actionable insights.

4. **Communication of Technical Insights**: Developed skills in translating technical results into actionable recommendations for non-technical stakeholders. Communicating complex statistical findings in a clear and understandable manner is key for effective decision-making.

5. **Iterative Improvement**: Recognized the value of iterative testing and analysis. Even after initial results, further experimentation and metric tracking are essential for refining insights and making informed decisions.

## Challenges Overcome

1. **Statistical Significance and Multiple Comparisons**:
   - **Challenge**: Managing Type I errors due to multiple comparisons during post-hoc testing.
   - **Solution**: Applied the Bonferroni Adjustment to control for the increased risk of Type I errors and ensure the reliability of the test results.

2. **Interpreting Results with Variability**:
   - **Challenge**: Significant differences in click-through rates between button variations, with some results being marginally significant.
   - **Solution**: Conducted detailed pairwise comparisons and further experiments to confirm findings and reduce uncertainty in the final results.

## Additional Reflections

1. **Adaptability in Analysis**:
   - **Insight**: Flexibility in adjusting the analysis approach was crucial. Adapting to missing data and unforeseen issues demonstrated the importance of having contingency plans and being ready to pivot as needed.

2. **Importance of Comprehensive Metrics**:
   - **Insight**: Tracking a variety of metrics beyond just click-through rates provided a more holistic view of user behavior. It highlighted the need for a multi-faceted approach to evaluating the effectiveness of changes.

3. **Learning from Real-World Data**:
   - **Insight**: Working with real-world data presented unique challenges not encountered in theoretical exercises. This underscored the value of practical experience in understanding data and their impact on analysis.

4. **Iterative Improvement Process**:
   - **Insight**: The iterative nature of experimentation and analysis reinforced the importance of continuous testing and refinement. It emphasized that initial results are often just the beginning of a deeper investigation.
